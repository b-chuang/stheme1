HELPING THOSE IN NEED
UNDERMYSEA Giving portion of their revenue to help Force Blue


The idea for FORCE BLUE grew out of a dive trip co-founders Jim Ritterhoff and Rudy Reyes took to the Cayman Islands in
Summer 2015 to meet up with their friend, Keith Sahm, General Manager of Sunset House, the oldest continuously operated
dive resort in the Caribbean. For Ritterhoff and Sahm, experienced recreational divers whoâ€™d been reef diving for
decades, this was just another week in paradise. But for Reyes, a former Recon Marine who had struggled with PTS and
depression since returning home from multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, the experience was nothing short of life
changing.
